#  Zero Trust Simulation in Azure (Free Tier)

This repository documents my journey of building a **Zero Trust security model in Azure Free Tier**.  
The goal is to simulate real-world Zero Trust principles using only free-tier services, step by step.  

##  Key Highlights
- **Identity & Access**: Microsoft Entra ID (users, groups, MFA)  
- **App Hosting**: Azure App Service (F1 free tier) with IP restrictions  
- **Visibility**: Log Analytics workspace with KQL queries  
- **Security Posture**: Defender for Cloud (Secure Score)  

## Steps Covered
1. Create identities & groups in Entra ID  
2. Register an app and assign user access  
3. Deploy App Service and lock network access  
4. Configure visibility, alerts & basic hardening  

##  Why This Matters
Zero Trust = **Never trust, always verify**.  
Every request, every system, every user is validated — reducing risk and protecting sensitive data.

 In upcoming updates, I’ll extend this simulation to **SOC-building in Azure**.  
Stay tuned and keep exploring
